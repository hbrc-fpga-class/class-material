  The class syllabus.



* verilog-tutorial/ - Directory structure with sequential lessons teaching the basics of Verilog
* presentation.pdf  - Slides from HBRC teaser talk. Generated using [Marp](https://github.com/marp-team/marp).
* presentation.md   - Source Markdown for PDF. Honestly not all that pretty to look at.
* images/           - Images for presentation
* [Class Members](class_members.md): The FPGA class member list.
