# HBRC FPGA Class Members

The class members are listed in alphabetical order by last name.
This is an excellent file to edit to get the hang of using `git`.
Adding a **SHORT** description of what you have done plus what
interests you in FPGA's is a reasonable thing to do.

Everything is this file is written in
[MarkDown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
which really easy to learn and use.
