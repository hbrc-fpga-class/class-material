# Robot Upgrades

This page lists parts or assecesories you can buy to upgrade the class robot.

# QTRX-HD-01RC Reflectance Sensor

The class robot comes with two Pololu QTR-MD-01RC Reflectance Sensors.
The idea was these sensors could be use as edge detectors, so the robot
could sense the edge of a table.  These reflective sensors don't 
do a good job if the table surface is not very reflective.

The [Pololu QTRX-HD-01RC](https://www.pololu.com/product/4301) 
have the same pin interface and thus work with the same
QTR fpga peripheral and HBA driver.  They work much better,
and are highly recommended.

# Extra Caster

The class robot comes with one caster, but it is possible to add
a second one to the Romi chasis, so you have a caster in the front
and the back.

# Gamepad

There is an HBA plugin for a gamepad.  It can be useful to use
the gamepad as a remote control for the robot.  It is recommended
to use a gamepad that has analog sticks, as well as the d-pad and buttons.

A good, inexpensive gamepad that will work with our robot is the

# Power Bank

To save batteries, you can power your robot using a Power Bank, that 
is designed for recharing cell phones.  We have had success plugging 
in the power bank into the Raspberry Pi micro usb, 
like it was an external 5V DC power supply. You also need to have
the 5V_OFF jumper (J19) installed and no batteries in the Romi
base when powering in this configuration.

The Power Bank we have tried is this one...

We strapped it to the back of the Raspberry Pi using these
